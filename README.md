Quantum mechanical simulation of a 2 dimensional ferromagnet

In this repo a 2 dimensional magnet is modelled as a lattice of (quantum mechanical) spins that can either be 'up' or 'down'. The program is initialised at some temperature, then the system evolves according to the interaction energies and random fluctuations. This leads to a uniform lattice of spins and therefore a net magnetisation when the temperature is below the critical temperature of the system. For more information please read the pdf report on this project.

To run different parts of the program scroll down to the bottom of the file and uncomment the function relating to the system evolution you wish to see.
